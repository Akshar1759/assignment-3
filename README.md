## ANS C
I chose the ISC License because it's easy to understand and allows people to use my project however they want. It's like saying, "Go ahead, use it, change it, and share it with others!" without worrying too much about legal stuff. I want to make it as easy as possible for people to work with my project and be creative with it.
